# fuelthefeed


Fuel the Feed is a challenge framework for creators designed to reward content that travels. It lets brands and organizers launch custom quests that track how creators spark engagement, spread influence, and drive virality across platforms. From posts that trend to reels that ripple, creators earn points for reach, creativity, and network effectsâ€”fueling both their feed and their reputation.
